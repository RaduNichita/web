# Introduction

Reconnaissance is an important first stage in any ethical hacking attempt. Before it is possible to exploit a vulnerability in the target system, it is necessary to find it. By performing reconnaissance on the target, an ethical hacker can learn about the details of the target network and identify potential attack vectors.\[[1]\]
 
Exploiting Tools / Security Testing Tools / Penetration Testing Tools are used for the discovery of vulnerabilities without attempting to actually exploit those vulnerabilities. We define testing as the discovery and attempted exploitation of vulnerabilities.\[[2]\]
 
# Burp Suite 
Since web applications present such a wide attack surface a need arises for systematization in attack attempts. A tool that can help in this respect is Burp Suite, a collection of tools that can be regarded as the equivalent to a debugger for web applications.

## Proxy
In its most basic use, Burp acts as a proxy and logs all requests and responses.  To install it as a proxy you need to check your browser settings:
* Firefox: Edit / Preferences / Network Settings / Manual Proxy Configuration. You should add 127.0.0.1:8080 for all protocols as you will need it both for HTTP and HTTPS.
* Since HTTPS requires server identity authentication browsers detect that something (Burp Proxy) is tampering with the communication so they will not display further. To overcome this you will need to export Burp’s CA certificate by visiting http://burpsuite and importing it in your browser.
* In Firefox, you can do this by accessing the Preferences option, and search for “Certificates” to find the “View Certificates button”.
 
Test that proxy-ing works by visiting http://slashdot.org in the browser. It will work and the browser will render the page. Burp can intercept the requests, but you have to turn on interception.
Initially Burp Proxy will try to intercept the requests from the browser and give you the opportunity to modify them. Go to the Proxy tab and the Intercept sub-tab and enable interception.
* To enable interception, click on the **Intercept is off** button to change it to **Intercept is on**. To the reverse operation in order to disable interception.
## Surface Mapping
Path discovery and spidering is another useful approach needed in assessing web app security. Check this feature in the **Target** tab in your Burp project.
## Intruder
With Burp Intruder, customized attacks can be automated against web applications. Customizing attacks requires that we specify one or more payloads and the position where the payloads will be placed in the website.
* Use Cases: Enumerating identifiers, harvesting useful data and fuzzing for vulnerabilities. \[[4]\]
## Repeater 
* The repeater can be used to repeat manually manipulated individual HTTP requests. This becomes tremendously useful when trying a variety of payloads on the same request. With repeater you can try parameters on the same page without doing any extra work with the browser. Issuing requests in a specific sequence becomes much easier and you can identify how the page reacts to changing parameters at each step.
* Use Cases: Testing a set of specific parameters on the same webpage request, reissuing requests to manually verify reported issues. \[[4]\]
## Sequencer
* Burp sequencer can be used to analyze the quality of randomness in a sample of data items. This ultimately means that the sequencer is good for testing data items that are intended to be unpredictable.
* Use Cases: Testing anti-CSRF tokens or password reset tokens etc.\[[4]\]
# OWASP Zap
Developed by OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project), ZAP or Zed Attack Proxy\[[5]\] is a multi-platform, open source web application security testing tool. ZAP is used for finding a number of security vulnerabilities in a web app during the development as well as testing phase. Other than its use as a scanner, ZAP can also be used to intercept a proxy for manually testing a webpage.\[[6]\] 
ZAP can identify:
* Application error disclosure
* Cookie not HttpOnly flag
* Missing anti-CSRF tokens and security headers
* Private IP disclosure
* Session ID in URL rewrite
* SQL injection
* XSS injection
 
# Sqlmap
Sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over database server.\[[7]\]
Once it detects one or more SQL injections on the target host, the user can choose to perform an extensive back-end database management system fingerprinting, retrieve DBMS session user and database, enumerate users, password hashes, privileges, databases, dump entire or user's specific DBMS tables/columns etc.\[[8]\]
# Nmap
Nmap is probably the most well-known tool for active network reconnaissance. Nmap is a network scanner designed to determine details about a system and the programs running on it. This is accomplished through the use of a suite of different scan types that take advantage of the details of how a system or service operates. By launching scans against a system or a range of IP addresses under a target’s control, a hacker can learn a significant amount of information about the target network.\[[1]\]
# Metasploit
Metasploit is primarily designed as an exploitation toolkit. I consists of a different modules that have prepackaged exploits for a number of vulnerabilities.
Although it was designed as an exploit toolkit, Metasploit can also be effectively used for reconnaissance.\[[1]\]
 
 
# Dirb
DIRB is a Web Content Scanner. It looks for existing (and/or hidden) Web Objects. It basically works by launching a dictionary based attack against a web server and analyzing the response.
DIRB comes with a set of preconfigured attack wordlists for easy usage but you can use your custom wordlists. Also DIRB sometimes can be used as a classic CGI scanner, but remember is a content scanner not a vulnerability scanner.
DIRB main purpose is to help in professional web application auditing. Specially in security related testing. It covers some holes not covered by classic web vulnerability scanners. DIRB looks for specific web objects that other generic CGI scanners can’t look for. It doesn’t search vulnerabilities nor does it look for web contents that can be vulnerables.\[[9]\]
 
# Commix
Commix (short for [comm]and [i]i njection e[x]ploiter) has a simple environment and it can be used, from web developers, penetration testers or even security researchers to test web applications with the view to find bugs, errors or vulnerabilities related to command injection attacks. By using this tool, it is very easy to find and exploit a command injection vulnerability in a certain vulnerable parameter or string. \[[10]\]
